# giv resolves color names via gdk_rgba_parse() (see color_parse() in
# giv-parser.cc, which calls gdk_rgba_parse for anything not of the form
# "r,g,b" or "r,g,b,a"). GDK's parser uses CSS3/SVG named colors, which are
# NOT the same table as the X11 rgb.txt file for a handful of names (most
# famously "green": X11 rgb.txt has (0,255,0), but CSS/SVG "green" is
# (0,128,0) - X11's (0,255,0) is CSS "lime"). Other historical X11/CSS
# mismatches include "maroon", "purple", and "gray"/"grey" percent shades.
#
# To stay byte-for-byte compatible with giv's actual runtime behavior, we
# seed the table from the X11R6 rgb.txt name list (for full name coverage,
# including things like "gray37" that aren't part of the small CSS named
# set) but then re-resolve every name through gdk_rgba_parse() - the same
# function giv calls - and prefer that result whenever it succeeds. Only
# names gdk_rgba_parse() can't parse at all fall back to the raw X11 rgb.txt
# value.
